# ToothPaste

## Description

ToothPaste is a pastebin-like online service that allows its users to store text in an easily accessible and shareable way. It also allows interaction between users via chat messages and voting.

ToothPaste has two kinds of users: registered and anonymous. Most of the features are equally available to both of these groups. While logged-in user edits and removes pastes by going to one's list of pastes, anonymous users can do the same by using a link with a secret token.

There are many levels of privacy on ToothPaste. A paste can be completely public and listed on the front page, or it can be hidden and only available with a direct link. Paste can also be set to be only available to its original logged-in owner. Unlisted paste can also be encrypted for additional security, in which case all users are required to enter a decryption key.

Original owner of a paste can grant edit permissions to other users, as well. Anyone who is able to view the paste can see and write chat messages, while original paste owner can also remove them. Logged-in viewers can also give one up or down vote for the paste.
